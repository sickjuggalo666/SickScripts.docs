# Ordering

Every restruant needs to fill its own inventories to make sure they have the food to provide to customers. UpNAtom comes with 2 options for this!&#x20;

1. Simple ordering like Buns, Cheese, Pancake Mix, Soda Bibs and more can be checked off in a menu. After a configed amount of time the items are 'Delivered' and deposited into the Freezer.
2. Items like meats, eggs, bacon and more will need to be picked up from a location set in the config. A van is provided that you will need to hang on to!&#x20;

When Buying products from the Farmers Market it will check you have the van and load the items into the truck. When you are done return to the store and go to the spot configed. From here the items will be removed from the trunk and added to the fridge.

If for some reason you lose the vehicle or it is destroyed the shipment will not be completed and will have to wait for a restart to try again. Plate is set by script and that SPECIFIC plate is checked for items and such. No Vehicle means No Order!
