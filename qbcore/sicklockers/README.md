Hey there and thanks for checking out my script! I hope you can find many uses for it and will enjoy it as much as me and my cities have! we use MF\_Inventory before but have made the move to OX\_Inventory!



## Dependencies

\~ Ox\_libs

\~ Ox\_target

\~ ESX



## Menu Options

\~ Chief can access any inventory that has been created so long as they know the name or case number for the locker/evidence storage!

\~ Lower rank officers can use this to store personal goods on them or if they go off duty they can leave their weapons in a safe place!

\~ Deletion is in there but will not work at this time until i figure a smooth way to delete they inventories! If you have ideas PLEASE let me know!

\~ You can use multiple locations with job based menus and rank based chief menus!

\~ Each case has a unique id that can be pulled up from anywhere really!



## Utilization

\~ Uses OX\_libs for context and Dialog

\~ Uses OX\_Inventory for storage/lockers

\~ Webhooks for Creating and Deleting Inventories!

\~ itâ€™s known that it seems like the stashs donâ€™t stay. Itâ€™s more of an illusion as you will think you are creating a new one but it will open the one already made. Figuring a way to skip that.

\~ removed stateBags as it seemed some issues but found a way to remove requirement for 1.9.2

\~ will be compatible with older esx versions out of box as it no longer uses state bags and I learned how to check for esx export and if nil use event.

\~ job lockers for other jobs set in config

\~ cleaner config with more options
