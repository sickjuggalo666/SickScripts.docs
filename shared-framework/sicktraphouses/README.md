## Gangs

**SickTrapHouses** helps gang members move drugs while they are stored in the Trap Houses. Each gang comes with tons of Config options that you can change to fit more of your servers! Ranging from custom gang names to ranks for certain things. The Config has a ton and allows for you to change a TON of the script from a **SINGLE** file! This brings more rivalry between gangs as knowing the enemy has something I can get makes it that much more fun!

Traphouses are now configed and saved to Database automatically! No need to run an sql when creating a new gang!

## Key Codes

Each Trap house has a unique KeyCode that comes preset but in game your members can change the KeyCode for security! This is a level of security that also helps lock cops out of the traps. These keyCodes are the keys to your stashes that generate an income for you, be careful.

{% hint style="danger" %}
These codes can be stolen and if the rival gang finds your trap houses they can change your KeyCode and lock you out of your own Traps. This will help lead gangs to interact and be more protective of their home turfs.
{% endhint %}

## Drugs

Drugs held in the traphouses are sold on timer that you can easily change to your liking! All items are configed with custom amounts and cash amounts. Each item has a configed account allowing you to add any type of currency to the items.

SickDirtyCops:

This Will be linked to my DirtyCops script meaning when you will be able to bring an item or some amount of money that will send you a RANDOM KeyCode that you will have to figure out where it goes!
