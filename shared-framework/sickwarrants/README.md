A WARRANT system for FiveM. Cops can set personal or vehicular warrants. Citizens can go to set locations you pick and use the event to check for warrants they may have. Cops only can delete active warrants. Bounties can be set by certain jobs.

`Make sure to go into your DataBase and insert the SQL that was provided in the downloaded files!`

Make sure to add ensure sickwarrants server.cfg!

Finally we will **boot up/restart** the server to make sure that the DB table is set and ready to be read from! Once the server is fully booted up and running you can fly in and start setting warrants on people or possibly even running from the warrants! 😏
