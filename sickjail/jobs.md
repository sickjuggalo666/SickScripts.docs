# Jobs

There are a few different jobs you can do and as I further the script I will be adding more jobs into the script to allow players more things to do while in prison and also help them access other parts of the Prison! Jobs will pay out money or Cigarettes. Money can be used to buy items from the kitchen Commissary! Cigarettes are used to trade gangs for illegal items. Each job has a set amount of tasks you must complete before you are able to turn in and get your reward.
